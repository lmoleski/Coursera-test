# Coursera-test
A repository that will be linked with RStudio

I am now writing something more to see how I can save it to the README.md file.

After writing the previous sentence, I learned that I do not "save" it to the README.md file, I "commit" it. I can either do this directly (which I did), or 
I can create a new branch with my new commit(s) and then it will ask me to creat a pull request. I will experiment with this option right now and see what happens.
